Data Abstract : Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variables :

	x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test, subject_test, subject_train: all contain data from the separate text files to be merged 	into a new data set
	
	x_set, y_set, and subject_set are the resulting tables after the merging of (x_test,x_train), (y_test, y_train), 		(subject_test,subject_train)
	
	features : contains variable names for columns in the x_set data table
	
	filter_features:  contains variable names for columns containing only STD or MEAN values and is applied to x_set
	
	activity :  activity lables from file activity.txt that replace values 1:6 in the y_set table
	
	total_sets: the merging of subject_set, y_set and x-set to produce a new data set comprised of only STD and MEAN 		variables
	
	mean_total_sets:  printed file that returns 180 records,  mean of the table according to activity and set
